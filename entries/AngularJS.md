# Angular Framework Overview

## üìå What is Angular?
Angular is a **TypeScript-based, full-featured front-end framework** developed and maintained by **Google**.  
It‚Äôs mainly used to build **large-scale, enterprise-level web applications** and **single-page applications (SPAs)**.  
Angular (released in 2016) is the successor of **AngularJS (2010)**, completely rewritten for modern web development.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Full Framework**: Provides everything out of the box (routing, HTTP, forms, state management, etc.).
- **TypeScript Support**: Strong typing, modern JS features, and better tooling.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable and modular UI building blocks.
- **Two-Way Data Binding**: Automatic sync between model and view.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Powerful system for managing services and dependencies.
- **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom attributes and behaviors.
- **RxJS & Observables**: Reactive programming for handling asynchronous data streams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts
- **Modules**: Organize an app into cohesive blocks of functionality.
- **Components**: Define UI parts with templates, logic, and styles.
- **Templates**: HTML enhanced with Angular directives and bindings.
- **Services & Dependency Injection**: Share logic and data across components.
- **Routing**: Built-in solution for navigation and SPAs.
- **Reactive Forms**: Robust form handling and validation.

## üì¶ Tooling
- **Angular CLI**: Powerful command-line tool for scaffolding, building, and deploying Angular apps.
- **RxJS**: Core library for reactive programming.
- **TypeScript Compiler**: Ensures type safety and advanced IDE support.
- **Angular DevTools**: Chrome/Firefox extension for profiling and debugging.
